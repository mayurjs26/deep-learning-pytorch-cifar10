## Overview

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The goal is to train a CNN model to accurately classify these images.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (3.6 or later)
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- Matplotlib

You can install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
